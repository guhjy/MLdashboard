# Introduction

Predictive analyses benefit from flexible, interactive tools that allow for fast evaluation and comparison of multiple machine learning approaches. At the same time, issues of non-reproducibility have been attributed to related statistical issues, including multiple testing and selective reporting in studies where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes.

A dashboard is a way to make an interactive cloud-based computational engine available alongside data sharing and print publication, enabling full transparency while creating a more attractive and impacting publication. Here we create a machine learning dashboard in RShiny.


# Features
- Simple GUI to many powerful machine learning methods.
- Preconfigurable, to walk the reader directly through ananalysis.
- Cloud-based (e.g. AWS) or locally hosted.
- Find structure quickly using fast unsupervised learning methods like PCA, hierarchical clustering, and network analysis.
- Fully automatic training,tuning, and testing of a vast array of prediction algorithms.
- Feature selection routines specific to each model.
- Easy investigation of interactions and subgroups using a GLMM designed for longitudinal hierarchical data, coupled with a plotting interface.
- Effortless evaluation of statistical inferences made under varying assumptions, such as model specification or the inclusion of confounding variables and mixed effects.
